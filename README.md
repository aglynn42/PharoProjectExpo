# Pharo Project Expo

### One page A4 posters describing Pharo projects

Pharo is a platform, an enabler. The various frameworks and libraries on top of Pharo constitute the actual building blocks for real world applications. We have a healthy ecosystem, but we need to improve discoverability. 

One of the things that we want to do during the upcoming Pharo Days (http://pharodays2015.pharo.org/) is a Project Expo as a replacement for the traditional Show Your Project presentations.

The idea is that authors, maintainers, supporters or even users create a single poster style A4 page highlighting one framework or library. Describe what it is, what the main features, advantages and applications are, give some links so where those interested can find out more, a bit like a datasheet.

You do not have to be a designer: you are marketing a software artefact to fellow developers.

Those posters turned in before Sunday January 25th will be printed on at least A3 format (maybe larger if possible). We will then put them up during the conference. Make sure to ask around if you want to talk face to face to someone about a particular topic.

Afterwards we will collect all posters into an online exhibition going forward.

You are free to create a page using any tool you like, just produce an A4 PDF without any too large coloured or filled areas (i.e. make it print friendly). And remember, small projects or sub projects are important too.
